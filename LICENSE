COMMENTARY ON THE RELEASE TO PUBLIC DOMAIN:

This section of the document is not legally binding in any way. It explains the so-called
"license" under which this material is released.

I don't have any rights on this stuff any more as of the time of its release, other than the
right to do whatever I want with it due to the fact that I, too, am a member of the public
just like you are. Just like the entire population is.

There is no legal framework common across all cultures, but in the jurisdiction under which this
release took place it is possible to waive all rights. You might live somewhere that this isn't
possible, but guess what?

I don't. I live somewhere that respects my rights and decisionmaking. You don't. This is a problem
WITH YOUR LEGAL SYSTEM ONLY, which is broken and out of the scope of anything I have the right to
do. If you don't like how your legal system works, go change it. It's explicitly, entirely, and
utterly NOT MY PROBLEM.

Dude, if you live under a dictatorship or something, or an authoritatian state, you've got
all kinds of other rights problems that I CAN'T FIX. If you live in a country that makes
shit up like "right of authorship" or some shit, it's NOT MY PROBLEM.

You're getting this thing with no strings attached whatsoever, waiving everything, including
things your legal framework might say I can't waive. Your legal framework doesn't apply to me,
and they're the ones violating the lack of license on this release, they're the ones 
impinging upon my right to dedicate to the Public Domain. But your legal framework, again,
and I can't explain this any more clearly:

IS. A. YOU. PROBLEM.

If you do crimes, because using something with no rights reserved is illegal where you
live, you're exercising your rights under the release to Public Domain. You're, prima facie,
exercising your rights under this so-called "license." Get sued or thrown in jail? Once again:
NOT. MY. PROBLEM. I reserve no right to prevent you from doing things that are crimes.
