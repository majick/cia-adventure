[qb64](https://github.com/QB64Official/qb64) port of Hugh Lampert's CIA Adventure, a 1980 interactive fiction title fort the TRS-80

## What is this?
This is a quick-n-dirty forward port of an "interactive fiction" game (that is, a text adventure) written in 1980 for TRS-80 Level II BASIC (an early Microsoft BASIC) to the modern QB64 compiler. Essentially, I did just enough work to make the syntax errors go away and compilation succeed.

Back in the extremely early 80s, probably 1980 or 1981, I had a cassette of "CIA Adventure" for the TRS-80 Model I — at the time we bought the computer, the thing was just called "a TRS-80", and the "Model I" thing was a retronym when other models came into existence — and since I was a little kid I had no idea how the hell to play this game. I mean, I'd played text adventures before but this game stumped me. I wasn't willing to cheat and read the program's code, so I just never finished it.
